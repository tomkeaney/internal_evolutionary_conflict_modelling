# internal_evolutionary_conflict_modelling
Repository for code used to run simulations, build plots and host supplementary resources for the in progress manuscript on modelling internal evolutionary conflict.

- You can view an example of using recusions to numerically find the equilibrium frequency of a selfish segregation distorter [here](https://tomkeaney.github.io/internal_evolutionary_conflict_modelling/).
