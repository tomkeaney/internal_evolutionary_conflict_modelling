# internal_evolutionary_conflict_modelling
Repository for code used to run simulations and build plots for the in progress manuscript on modelling internal evolutionary conflict.

You can view an example of using recusions to numerically find the equilibrium frequency of a selfish segregation distorter [here](https://tomkeaney.github.io/internal_evolutionary_conflict_modelling/).
